- Requirements Specification.

  We want to develop a software application that allow us to make those tasks related with invoicing activity
  and business management on scope of SMBs (Small and Medium Business). Therefore, the application must
  be able to:

    - Create, load and store invoices both sale and buy that involve either customers or clients.
    - Management of products, customers and providers so will be able to add, modify and remove each one of these.
    - Show reports for invoicing volume, current stocks and unpaid invoices.

    * Note: Likely these requirements will be extended and/or improved on each future version.
