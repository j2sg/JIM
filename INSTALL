- Requirements

      - Qt4 libraries with QtSql module.
      - Qt4 headers with QtSql module header.
      - Makefile generation tool QMake.
        
        You can obtain Qt at http://qt.nokia.com/ or through 
        your package manager on unix systems.

- Compilation

   - Generate a platform-specific makefile:

      qmake

   - Build the application:

      - On Unix:

         make

      - On Windows:

         mingw32-make

   
   Now we have the qinvoicer binary ready to execute.
